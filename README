utalk - a UDP-based full-screen talk protocol and client
--------------------------------------------------------

This is a beta version of utalk, and the documentation is not yet
complete.

Please see the file PROTOCOL for the utalk protocol specifications, and
the manpage (utalk.1) for general documentation.

To compile utalk, edit the Makefile to suit your system, and run
``make''.  utalk requires an ANSI C compiler such as gcc, and should be
fairly portable on most modern Unix-like systems.  

utalk has been tested on a 64-bit system (Linux/axp), and should work
without modification on any system where ints are 32 bit, shorts 16 bit
and chars 8 bit.  If this is not the case for your system, edit the
definitions for srdp_u32, srdp_u16 and srdp_u8 in srdpdata.h.

If you have trouble compiling or getting utalk to run on some platform,
please tell me about it.

Once compiled, the utalk binary is ready to run; you can install it
on the system by typing ``make install''.
